# Todo-App-React

React Todo Application with User Authentication
Overview
This React application demonstrates user authentication and a todo list management system. It features user registration, login, and a todo list where users can add, edit, delete, and toggle the completion status of todos. The application uses React Context for state management and does not rely on a backend.
